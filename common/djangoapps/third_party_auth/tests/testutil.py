    """Simulate that a pipeline is currently running.

    You can use this context manager to test packages that rely on third party auth.

    This uses `mock.patch` to override some calls in `third_party_auth.pipeline`,
    so you will need to provide the "target" module *as it is imported*
    in the software under test.  For example, if `foo/bar.py` does this:

    >>> from third_party_auth import pipeline

    then you will need to do something like this:

    >>> with simulate_running_pipeline("foo.bar.pipeline", "google-oauth2"):
    >>>    bar.do_something_with_the_pipeline()

    If, on the other hand, `foo/bar.py` had done this:

    >>> import third_party_auth

    then you would use the target "foo.bar.third_party_auth.pipeline" instead.

    Arguments:

        pipeline_target (string): The path to `third_party_auth.pipeline` as it is imported
            in the software under test.

        backend (string): The name of the backend currently running, for example "google-oauth2".
            Note that this is NOT the same as the name of the *provider*.  See the Python
            social auth documentation for the names of the backends.

    Keyword Arguments:
        email (string): If provided, simulate that the current provider has
            included the user's email address (useful for filling in the registration form).

        fullname (string): If provided, simulate that the current provider has
            included the user's full name (useful for filling in the registration form).

        username (string): If provided, simulate that the pipeline has provided
            this suggested username.  This is something that the `third_party_auth`
            app generates itself and should be available by the time the user
            is authenticating with a third-party provider.

    Returns:
        None
